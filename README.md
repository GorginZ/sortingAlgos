# sortingAlgos

Playing with C# MVC stuff by making a crumby thing that renders and itterates a collection being sorted by chosen algo. 
Just practicing using C# in a non-terminal app setting and purely in back end. I've been reading about calculous and big O recently so might build out a piece of writing on different complexities at some point but really this is just to make a C# back end with a react front which I've never done.
